# netflix-auto-skip

Give the same auto-skip ability to the Netflix recap and intro buttons as seen on the next episode button.

Unpacked extension for Chromium based browsers.

## Installation

## Usage
You can disable/enable recap or intro skipping using a dedicated widget at the top right corner of your browser.
When enabled, skipping behaves the same as with the *Next Episode* button. When the mouse is moved during skipping, the skipping is canceled. The same sliding effect is added to the buttons.
